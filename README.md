# k-Medoids Calculator for geolocations
-----------
`k_Medoids_Calculator.ipynb`: this is an interactive python notebook that runs the kMedoids algorithm for locations having latitude and longitud from two different approachs: firstly, using the travel distance by car, in minutes; secondly, using the geodesical distance. After that, both series of results are plotted in a map and some mathematical constants are calculated.

`k_Medoids_Elbow_Heuristic.ipynb`: this is an interactive python notebook that runs the kMedoids algorithm for several values of the unique hyperparameter, *k*, the number of clusters. Then, it plots the elbow representation in order to asses an appropiate number of clusters.

´kMedoids_Allande1773.ipynb´: an interactive python notebook that runs the kMedoids algorithm for all the villages of Allande's Council in Asturias at 1773 from a historical census. Several distances have been used.

There's a link inside each interactive python notebook to an online-executable copy in Google Colaboratory.

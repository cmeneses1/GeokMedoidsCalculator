# k-Medoids Calculator for geolocations
-----------
This is an interactive python notebook the runs the kMedoids algorithm for locations having latitude and longitud from two different approachs: firstly, using the travel distance by car, in minutes; secondly, using the geodesical distance. After that, both series of results are plotted in a map and some mathematical constants are calculated.
